\begin{abstract}
Bipartite user-object networks are becoming increasingly popular in representing
user interaction data in a web or e-commerce environment. They have certain
characteristics and challenges that differentiates them from other bipartite
networks. This paper analyzes the properties of five real world user-object
networks. In all cases we found a heavy tail object degree distribution with
popular objects connecting together a large part of the users causing
significant edge inflation in the projected users network. We propose a novel
edge weighting strategy based on \emph{tf-idf} and show that the new scheme
improves both the density and the quality of the community structure in the
projections. The improvement is also noticed when comparing to partially random
networks.
